# Combo-and-damage-system
A simple prototype testing damage system and checking how to implement combo attacks.

The aims of this prototype were:
  - to find balanced system for calucating damage
  - to check if it is possible to create combo moves system using Macanim engine
 
 There are two possible formulas for calculating the damage as well as several additional damage types such as: 
 fire, ice, electric, magical.
 
 The combo system allows to deal more damage if attack button was pushed in proper tempo.
